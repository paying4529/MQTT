### Abstract
We use STM32 and Rpi to create an interactive way for interior design. By setting up RSSI network, we can do the triangulation and 
find the user's location. The STM32 board supports accelerometer and magnetometer for motion and heading detection, which allows 
user to switch object and change facing direction. The STM32 board would also handle button as IRQ function for setting object. 
The user can walk around the room and place the furniture at anywhere he/she wants. 

### Motivation
Traditional interior design model are usually accessed by mouses and keyboards. All the furnitures must be set up on the computer 
remotely, which may be less straightforward.... Thus, we want to provide a more interactive and straightforward way, so that the user can directly walk inside the new house and 
place the furniture at their wish.
